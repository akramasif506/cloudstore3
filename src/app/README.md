# ReNest - A Secondhand Marketplace

This is a Next.js application built with Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To run this application, you need to provide your Firebase project credentials.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:** In the root of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
2.  **Copy the template:** Copy the contents from the `.env.example` file into your new `.env` file.
3.  **Add your credentials:** Replace the placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual Firebase project credentials. You can find these in your Firebase project settings under "Service accounts".

After setting up your environment variables, you can start the development server.
